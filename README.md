# To do List üìù

The "To do list" project aims to help people organize everyday tasks. Made with CRUD - Create, Read and Delete, which basically consists of adding a task, 
editing it and if you don't want it or you have added a misleading task, which we can delete.

In addition, I used localStorage which allows storing data locally, where the user can close the page, and when returning the data will remain.

Project developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
